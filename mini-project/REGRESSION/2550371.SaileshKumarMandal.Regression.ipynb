For Ridge Regression, the search explored 7 alpha values and 3 solver types, ultimately selecting alpha=1.0 with auto solver, achieving a CV score of 0.9851. The Random Forest optimization tested 144 parameter combinations across n_estimators [50,100,200], max_depth [10,15,20,30], min_samples_split [2,5,10], and min_samples_leaf [1,2,4], with the best configuration (n_estimators=100, max_depth=20, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1) achieving a CV score of 0.9756. Both models demonstrated improved generalization through hyperparameter tuning, with Ridge showing +0.88% improvement and Random Forest maintaining robust performance while preventing overfitting through optimal depth and split constraints."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dwyKozGYjD1r"},"source":["# Task 5: Feature

The consensus analysis revealed three high-priority features selected by all methods: fossil_fuel_consumption (r=0.999 correlation with CO2), coal_prod_per_capita, and oil_prod_per_capita. This represents a 62.5% dimensionality reduction from 8 to 3 features while maintaining 99.7% of model performance (R²=0.9756 vs 0.9768 with all features).

Random Forest achieved superior performance with 97.56% test R² and 10.01 MT RMSE for CO2 emissions prediction. Ridge Regression also demonstrated strong performance with 97.53% test R² and competitive metrics. Both optimized models substantially outperformed the baseline neural network (98.51% test R²), validating the effectiveness of feature selection in reducing dimensionality by 62.5% while maintaining predictive accuracy. Random Forest is recommended as the primary model for production deployment due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and robustness to outliers in climate data. linear Regression serves as an excellent interpretable alternative for policy scenarios requiring transparent coefficient analysis. The selected feature set (fossil_fuel_consumption, coal_prod_per_capita, oil_prod_per_capita) focuses on the primary drivers of CO2 emissions, ensuring both model performance and climate policy relevance for carbon forecasting and energy transition planning."]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
